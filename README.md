# Chat with Your Data
This repository contains the code and implementations I developed while following the "Chat with Your Data" course, which explores Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques using LangChain. The course covers essential steps for building a chatbot capable of interacting with your own documents, including document loading, splitting, creating vectorstores with embeddings, retrieval mechanisms, and integrating question-answering and chat functionalities.
